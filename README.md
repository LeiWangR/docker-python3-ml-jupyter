# Docker for Machine Learning with Python3

## Introduction

"Docker is a software technology providing containers, promoted by the company Docker, Inc. Docker provides an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level virtualization on Windows and Linux."

Why Docker for Machine Learning? TBD.

## Docker Terminology

- **Container:** can be thought of as mini-Virtual Machine (VM) that are light-weight, disposable.
- **Images:** are essentially snapshots of the containers whose running state is saved using Docker Command Line Interface (CLI) or generated using **Dockerfile** (see below). 
- **Dockerfile:** can be considered as an automated setup file. This file is used to create/modify Docker images.
